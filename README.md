## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **static Amazon-inspired clone website** developed to **enhance my front-end development skills** and gain hands-on experience with core web technologies.

The website layout, product sections, and navigation are designed to resemble an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon, with a primary focus on **visual structure and user interface design**.

The project is built using **pure HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript**, without using any modern frameworks or libraries such as **React, Angular, Vue, or Bootstrap**.  
It is intended **only for viewing and learning purposes** and not for real-world commercial use.

Through this project, I practiced creating well-structured web pages, organizing files properly, styling components, and adding simple interactivity to improve the overall user experience.
